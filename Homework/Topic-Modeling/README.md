## Overview -- Unsupervised learning: Finding important features (NMF)

This sprint will use Non-Negative Matrix factorization (NMF) to discover topics from our NYT corpus.  Similar to kmeans and hierarchical clustering, NMF is a technique to help discover latent properties (features) in our data that a human might not have been able to see otherwise.

## Goals

* Matrix factorization
* Dimensionality reduction
* Latent properties
* Linear combination of features

Exercise in [pair.md](pair.md).
