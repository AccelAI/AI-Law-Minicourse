# AI & Law Mini-Course
 
## Logistics
Date: Jan 22nd & 29th
Location: Santa Clara University
Time: 100 min & 4 hours of homework / session
Audience: Graduate and Undergraduate (Non-CS major) Students
Project: Topic Modeling of Supreme Court Documents 
 
## Description
The AI and Law Mini-course is designed to expose students to real-world use cases of Artificial Intelligence in law practice. We'll begin with a high-level overview of artificial intelligence concepts and techniques, then walk through an applied example of topic modeling for supreme court cases using Natural Language Processing. You'll also learn where to find public datasets for use in future research and applications.
 
## Setup
Make sure to follow the [AI-Workshop-Installation-Guides](https://github.com/AccelAI/AI-Workshop-Installation-Guides) to get your computer set up for the applied lab and homework sessions.

Virtual Office Hours for students who struggle with downloads on Anaconda distribution locally or through Docker.

**Your computer must be set up to run an Anaconda distribution through Docker or locally prior to our first session on January 22nd** 

If you have a problem following the installation guides, set an appointment for a 15 min troubleshooting session - https://calendly.com/accelai/15min-technical/.

Join our slack channel - http://bit.ly/accelai-slack. Once in slack, you'll receive an invite to the private channel setup for this course. We'll be sending any additional materials through the private slack channel.
