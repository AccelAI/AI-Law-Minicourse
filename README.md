# AI & Law Mini-Course
 
## Logistics

- Date: Jan 22nd & 29th
- Location: Santa Clara University
- Time: 100 min & 4 hours of homework / session
- Audience: Graduate and Undergraduate (Non-CS major) Students
- Project: Topic Modeling of Supreme Court Documents 
 
## Description

The AI and Law Mini-course is designed to expose students to real-world use cases of Artificial Intelligence in law practice. We'll begin with a high-level overview of artificial intelligence concepts and techniques, then walk through an applied example of topic modeling for supreme court cases using Natural Language Processing. You'll also learn where to find public datasets for use in future research and applications.
 
## Setup

Make sure to follow the [AI-Workshop-Installation-Guides](https://github.com/AccelAI/AI-Workshop-Installation-Guides) to get your computer set up for the applied lab and homework sessions.

### Docker (Optional)

If you are using Docker to access the Anaconda distribution:

Start Docker, e.g., using spotlight search (by pressing the cmd + space bar) or Finder to navigate to your Applications folder and double-clicking on the Docker icon

**Open Workshop Repository**

Open a new terminal window by pressing **cmd + t** and move into the workshop directory by executing:

```
cd ~/AI-Law-Minicourse
```

**If this command returns an error, your directory is located in a different file path** 



**Link Cloned Github Repository to Docker**

Link this directory to your Docker container by executing:

```
docker run -it --rm --name ai-law -v ~/AI-Law-Minicourse -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006
```

More details on sharing files from your local machine into a Docker container can be found here: https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker/wiki/Sharing-files-with-host-machine

### Installation Issues

Virtual Office Hours for students who struggle with downloads on Anaconda distribution locally or through Docker.

**Your computer must be set up to run an Anaconda distribution through Docker or locally prior to our first session on January 22nd** 

If you have a problem following the installation guides, set an appointment for a 15 min troubleshooting session - https://calendly.com/accelai/15min-technical/.

# Homework

## Assignments

- Setup a Github Account
    * [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository into your Github
    * Create a new repository called "AI-Law-Minicourse-HW"
    * Clone the **AI-Law-Minicourse-HW** to your local machine
    * Add a **Readme.md** where you'll be adding your notes for the homework
    * Apply [Markdown Formatting](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) to this document along with your answers
    * Push the file from your local repository on your computer to the master branch on Github
        - Refer to the Github resources listed below if you get stuck! 

- Review the Applied Example covered in class - [Supreme Court Topic Modeling](./Supreme_Court_Topic_Modeling/)
    * For each step in this directory, write a paragraph or two of your interpretation of the code - in your own words describing what the code is doing
    * Include a description of the workflow being applied, what format the data is in during each step, what each function is doing, etc

- [Complete the Tutorial - Vector Representation of Words using TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec)
    * Launch an empty Jupyter Notebook in your new **AI-Law-Minicourse-HW** local repository
        - If you downloaded Docker and are using the Docker-Hub image of Anaconda, you'll need to connect your new repository to your Docker instance
        - If you downloaded Anaconda locally, you should be able to launch jupyter notebook from the local directory and have access to the needed scientific packages
    * Make sure to import tensorflow into the Jupyter Notebook
    * Add the code from this tutorial in your new Jupyter Notebook, make sure it executes as decribed
        - Save your work intermittently
    * Push your saved work from your local repository to the Github repository for assessment
        - Successfult completion of this tutorial includes completing a push to Github with your new Jupyter Notebook which has run all the code in this tutorial.
