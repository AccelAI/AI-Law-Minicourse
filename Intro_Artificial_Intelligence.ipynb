    "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a text mining technique used to categorize documents. Have you ever looked at blog posts on a web site, and wondered if it is possible to generate the tags automatically? Well, that's exactly the kind of problem TF-IDF is suited for.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting the differences between TF-IDF and sentiment analysis. Although both could be considered classification techniques for text, their goals are distinct. On the one hand, sentiment analysis aims to classify documents into opinions such as 'positive' and 'negative'. On the other hand, TF-IDF classifies documents into categories inside the documents themselves. This would give insight about what the reviews are about, rather than if the author was happy or unhappy. If we analyzed product review data from an e-commerce site selling computer parts, we would end up with groups of documents about 'laptop', 'mouse', 'keyboard', etc. We would gain a large amount of data about the types of reviews that had been written, but would not learn anything about what the users thought of those products. Although the algorithms are similar in that they classify text, the results of each give us unique insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is useful when you have a document set, particularlly a large one, which needs to be categorized. It is especially nifty because you don't need to train a model ahead of time and it will automatically account for differences in lengths of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a large corporate website with tens of thousands of user contributed blog posts. Depending on the tags attached to each blog post, the item will appear on listing pages on various parts of the site. Although the authors were able to tag things manually when they wrote the content, in many cases they chose not to, and therefore many blog posts are not categorized. Empirics show that only a small fraction of users will take the time to manually add tags and assist with categorization of posts and reviews, making voluntary organization unsustainable. Such a document set is an excellent use-case for TF-IDF, because it can generate tags for the blog posts and help us display them in the right areas of our site. Best of all, no intern would have to suffer through manually tagging them on their own! A quick run of the algorithm would go through the document set and sort through all the entries, eliminating a great deal of hassle."
